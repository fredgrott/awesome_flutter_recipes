# IDE Configs

Real flutter designers use VSCode instead of IntelliJ based Android Studio as its node-web-based and is so much better in features and usefulness. You can install either the stable version or the insiders version:


[Stable VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Insiders VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)

Do not confuse that with the Visual Code edition which one needs with the Net SDK to produce the Windows flutter app via the SDk build tools:

[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

Visual Studio 2022 automatically downloads and installs the Visual Studio Build Tools which you need for the Flutter SDK to be able to compile MS Windows targeted Flutter Apps.

If you prefer to just get the Visual Studio Build Tools instead its here:

If and when Google bases Android Studio on IntelliJ's web-based Fleet IDE is when I will include Android Studio configs.
