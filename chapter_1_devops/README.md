# Chapter 1 DevOps

The Flutter docs usually do not cover DevOPS well enough for aspiring app designers. Thus, I cover what you the app designer need to know in this DevOPS chapter.

The sequence is:

-IDE Configs
-WidgetApp Setup
-Lint
-Logging
-Asset Caching
-Build Variants
-Catching Errors
-Testing Setup
