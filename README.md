# Awesome Flutter Recipes

This is the code repository to the Awesome Flutter Recipse book. It's an opinionated look at what Flutter Recipes to build awesome Flutter Apps.

Opinionated in that I use some 3rd party plugins and techniques to fill the holes that are both in the Material Design 3 implementation in the Flutter framework and the other holes in the Flutter SDK. This is why I prefer not have a GDE certification so that I am free from Google's influence to really detail the right design way to create awesome Flutter apps.

The collection of coding techniques span from DevOPS to Animation, Navigation, Error Handling, etc.
